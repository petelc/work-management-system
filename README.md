# Work Management System

## Summary

The work management system is a application that enables a user to submit project and/or change requests. These requests will be managed by
the Change Management Board and either approved or denied. If approved then the request is placed on a board that is categorized by section
from which the task can be either taken by a tech or assigned by manager.

## Persistence

Initially I am using SQLite to develop application. Eventually I want to use SQL Server or Postgres
